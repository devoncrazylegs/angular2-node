Installation instructions

1 - run 'npm install' inside root folder for NodeJS layer dependencies

2 - run 'npm install' inside '/client/' folder for Angular2 layer dependencies

3 - run 'gulp build' '/client/' folder to build CSS and Javascript files

4 - run 'npm start' to start the application. Please bear in mind I have left some development dependencies in this application to give clarity as to how it was built


About this application

This application is built in Angular2 and sits upon a custom NodeJS / Express server. It uses a Redis Instance for data persistence, Gulp as the build runner and SASS for all CSS.
I have used KarmaJS for testing


Important commands

'npm start' inside the root folder to start the application
'npm run test' inside client folder to start Karma Test Runner

If you have any problems with the Redis instance please
install redis server -- sudo apt-get install redis-server --save
